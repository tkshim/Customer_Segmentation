The benefits segmentation answers the question of why consumers buy from you. What benefits do they receive from your product? They may desperately need to solve a problem that only your product or service solves. Alternatively, they may want to showcase a posh and fun fashion sense with your funky sunglasses. Or the entire purchase decision may be based solely on price.
  
This is an important question to answer. If you discover that a majority of your customers only frequent your candy shop because it’s within walking distance of their house, work, or school, then you want to consider an ad campaign that targets this specific audience. You also don’t want to advertise your new, high-end, luxury suit to the segment of customers who buy only when you have sales or other promotions.
  
Customer surveys and A/B testing can really help you uncover the true motivations of your customers.

  
# How to Analyze ?
Big Data has been a key determining factor in identifying behavioral segmentation. Customer records show buying patterns over time that could prompt promotions and sales based on spending habits of particular brands. This is a unique, personalized customer experience tailored directly to the consumer.
Behavioral traits include:
  
- Patterns of use
- Price sensitivity
- Brand loyalty
- Benefits sought
